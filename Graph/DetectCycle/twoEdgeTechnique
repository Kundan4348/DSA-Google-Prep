In this we select an edge and then we can check multiple things:

-> Detect cycle in the graph
-> Find smallest cycle in the graph
-> Find the largest cycle in the graph
-> Redundent Connection in the graph

Here we select an edge and then find using dfs or bfs that from start vertex of this edge can we 
reach to the end vertex of this edge
-> Yes then there is cycle 
-> No then there is no cycle
